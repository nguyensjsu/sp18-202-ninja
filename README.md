Project Idea We have build a game named "Black Panther". The theme of the game is as following, In the city of Wakanda there lived Black Panther, the prince of Wakanda. His father was dethroned by his enemy Aries. Hence Black Panther was thrown out of the city. In order to win the Kingdom back he has to cross three hurdles. In the first hurdle Black Panther will have to face 2 enemies in order to obtain the powerful Weapon & his custom suit, with the weapon Black Panther can Kill Aries. Black Panther has to collect vibranium for his suit to remain charged.
