### XP Value : Feedback

We will take every iteration commitment seriously by delivering working software. We demonstrate our software early and often then listen carefully and make any changes needed. We will talk about the project and adapt our process to it, not the other way around.

* Week 1 : Feedback had been one of the important XP values that team followed in first week. For first week we count all the meetings as iteration. At each iteration we discussed about how a working prototype of the game can be developed and delivered. For every decision discussed and finalized continuous feedback was taken to understand the process that can be applied to achieve those decision in reality.

* Week 2 : Team developed the first working prototype using GreenFoot game engine. During week2 we had been taking feedback from each team member regarding Technologies that can be used. Based of the feedback team concluded to go ahead with GreenFoot.

* Week 3 : A round of feedback was taken regarding the intial prototype. Few points related to dynamic background and hurdle placing were discussed.In the next increment Team would work on changing the background dynamically.
