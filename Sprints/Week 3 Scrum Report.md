#Rohit:

###What tasks did I worked on and are complete?
*I designed a user story for Factory method design pattern.
*I discussed the dependency for this pattern.
*I also created the class structures of  all dependent objects and actors which we used in Factory Method Design Pattern implementation.



###What am I planning to work on next? 
*I will discuss with the team on how to implement this design pattern in the game in the Panther World.
*I will also perform the unit testing of all the codes which I'll implement and also check for continuous integration .


###What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
*As this design pattern is dependent on other objects and classes and discuss on how to proceed with the development.
