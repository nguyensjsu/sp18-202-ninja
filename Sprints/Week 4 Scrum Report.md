# Rohit:
### What tasks did I worked on and are complete?

    I designed sample code for Factory method design pattern.
    I discussed the dependency for this pattern with the team.
    I implemented the class structures of all dependent objects and actors which we used in Factory Method Design Pattern implementation.
    I discussed with team and integrated all and pushed the changes.

### What am I planning to work on next?

    I will also perform the unit testing of all the codes which I'll implement and also check for continuous integration.
    I will check for the UML diagrams necessary for my code and check dependencies accordingly.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

    Will check for the dependencies in the UML diagrams and wait for others to discuss their implementations of assigned patterns and finalize the diagrams.
