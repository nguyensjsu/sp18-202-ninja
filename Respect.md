# Respect is one of the core values in XP. 

All the team members working together should respect each others contributions. They should value the time, effort and help
put in by each one of them so that all feel appreciated.
This in turns helps to increase the productivity and work towards one goal.

## Week1:

* In our project we first discussed with pen and paper and tried to get all the ideas for game, characters, design patterns
and documentation. We value each others work and come at a single point to finalize the issues only on paper. We decided that
each one will research and study all the information related to game.

* We all respected each others thoughts and idea about how we should take the project ahead.

## Week2:
* We studied all the required technologies, we sat and discussed on the modules and design patterns. We decided rather than
building the game and then incorporating the design patterns we will try to work hard in first place to design with the design
pattern itself.

* We all respected each other and then came up with tasks. It was Venkatesh and Rohit who will create all the task issues and 
then distributed the design pattern implementation.

## Week3:
* We respected work done by all of us as we had other subjects midterms, assignments. We checked each others work and provided 
feedback so that we atleast get near to game with basic design patterns. All had their class prototypes ready and were working 
separately to code it with design patterns.

* We came together thrice this week and discussed the requirements and who is working on what as all were always available
library.

* Rohit and Venkatesh worked on to complete the factory and template structure. Pradynesh is working on observer for counter, Gaurav
is working on Command to start the play and Rajib on black panther's state maintainence.

## Week4:
* Everybody really tried to work hard to setup all the patterns as assigned. We lagged at first as other projects for other courses were also going on.
* We respected as everybody tried to show what was expected.
* All have worked and now we will work on integration of the same and commit after testing.
* We all respected all the efforts put by everybody.
