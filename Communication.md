# XP Value : Communication

Communication is one of the core  values in XP.
Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face daily.We worked together on everything from requirement to code. We created the best solution to our problem that we can together


## Week #1

* Software is developed as quickly as possible when there is some sort of communication in projects. Everyone is part of the team and should communicate face to face. As a team, we had face to face communication couple of times this week. We created our group on Whatsapp, a messaging service and had interactions with each other on Whatsapp regarding the different game topics. We met and discussed the game topics and received everyone's feedback on all the topics. We discussed on which technologies we are going to base our project on and hence we decided Black Panther game as our best choice.

## Week #2
