#Rohit:

###What tasks did I worked on and are complete?
*I studied 'The Factory Design Pattern' as assigned in the team.
*Wrote a simple code to understand how factory design pattern is implemented.


###What am I planning to work on next?
*Design a user story for the Factory design pattern. 
*I will discuss with the team how to implement this factory design pattern in the game concerning their work and ideas as all patterns will be merging in the game.


###What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
*I am dependent on the prototype of BlackPanther hero, this will so that I can go ahead and implement my template method.
*Also I have wait for other team members input on the changes they are making according to which I have to design the template method for the 'Vibranium' the black panther will eat/grab to earn points and move forward.
