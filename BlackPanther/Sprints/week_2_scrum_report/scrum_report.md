# Rohit:

### What tasks did I worked on and are complete?
* I studied 'The Factory Design Pattern' as assigned in the team.
* Wrote a simple code to understand how factory design pattern is implemented.


### What am I planning to work on next?
* Design a user story for the Factory design pattern. 
* I will discuss with the team how to implement this factory design pattern in the game concerning their work and ideas as all patterns will be merging in the game.


### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
* I am dependent on the prototype of BlackPanther hero, this will so that I can go ahead and implement my template method.
* Also I have wait for other team members input on the changes they are making according to which I have to design the template method for the 'Vibranium' the black panther will eat/grab to earn points and move forward.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
* I will be triggerring the game start using this pattern and I am dependent on the basic game background and design to get complete.



# Pradynesh:

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
* I am dependent on the design and implementation of the BlackPanther hero class as based on that and timer I have to add the counters as observers for updating the life, bullet counts, score.


# Rajiv:

### What tasks did I worked on and are complete?
* I studied 'The State Design Pattern' as assigned in the team.
*Wrote a simple code to understand how state design pattern is implemented


### What am I planning to work on next?
* I will design the user story for this design pattern 
* I will discuss with the team how to implement this state design pattern in the game concerning their work and ideas as all patterns will be merging in the game.


### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
* I am dependent on Venkatesh and Rohit as they will be working on Factory and template patterns
* Also I have to wait to develop the prototype of BlackPanther hero so that I can go ahead and implement my state.
