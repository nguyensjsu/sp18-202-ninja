# Simplicity

It is extremely important to be close to ground reality as much as possible. We have to implement a new capability in simplest possible way. We do not have to develop feature which we do not need at this very moment. We also ought to have more communication which will help get clear picture of what needs to be done.

## Week 1 :

Implementing the game is an unexplored territory for the team. After exploring the ambitious ideas, we did a feasibility check of time and resources and finalized to make the BlackPanther Game. The game has to have two levels of the game, which is the long-term plan. Currently, we have explored and decided to go ahead with making the first level of the game, so that we have a working prototype at the earliest with us. Next, depending on the bandwidth of resources, we will go ahead with adding features and levels for the game.

## Week 2 :

Everyone started to pour on ideas of directly developing the application. But firstly we have to be precise with requirements so that we do not over-do things and complicate it. We just need to focus on first developing user stories clearly so as to go to next step of developing UML diagrams.

## Week 3 :

There were ideas floating as to how different and descriptive user stories can be. We have sticked to simple format for user stories with fulfilling the three basic parameters: " ' As a ', 'I want to <> ','so that <> '" format.for each object involved in the user stories.

## Week 4 :

During Development of the game team has agreed to follow a simple coding practice which will keep code uniformity and will be easier of other team members to understand the code.

## Week 4 :
The task is decided to test the functionalities and fix defects in the game. Since this is the last week and almost all features are developed as were planned, we have decided that the team members can try new feature development on their local versions. But the priority is to test and ensure the functionalities developed by each member is working with the results as were decided. There is also a cross check of functionalities of each method in the game by peers, so that everyone is aware of all things in game, as well as detect any bug which might have been missed. We want a working game with minimum of defects to be delivered for the live version.
